            <p class="goal-text">
              Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity
              the world faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change,
              food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is
              essential. Working towards this goal is especially important as it
              interlinks with other Sustainable Development Goals.

            </div>
            <p class="goal-text">
              Sustainable consumption and production is about promoting resource
              and energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing
              access to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better
              quality of life for all. Its implementation helps to achieve
              overall development plans, reduce future economic, environmental
              and social costs, strengthen economic competitiveness and reduce
              poverty.

            <p class="goal-text">
              Climate change is a real and undeniable threat to our entire
              civilization. The effects are already visible and will be
              catastrophic unless we act now. Through education, innovation and
              adherence to our climate commitments, we can make the necessary
              changes to protect the planet. These changes also provide huge
              opportunities to modernize our infrastructure which will create
              new jobs and promote greater prosperity across the glob.
